## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Logistic Regression** using Python to predict customer churn. The focus is on understanding input features, model performance, and how log loss changes when features are added or removed.

---

## Objective
- Learn and implement Logistic Regression in Python.
- Understand the impact of input features on model performance.
- Compute and analyze **log loss** for different feature sets.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this lab includes various customer features related to churn prediction, such as:
- `callcard`
- `wireless`
- `equip`
- `income`
- `employ`
- Other original features from the IBM lab dataset.

---

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install required packages:
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to experiment with the Logistic Regression model

## Practice Exercised Completed
Part a: Adding the callcard Feature
- Updated the features list to include callcard.

- Computed the log loss for this feature set.

- Log loss value obtained: 0.6039104035600186

## Credits

- Original lab and dataset provided by IBM Skills Network.

- Additional exercises and analysis completed by me.
